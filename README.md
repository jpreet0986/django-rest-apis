Install packages
The easiest way to install the python modules and keep them up-to-date is with a Python-based package manager called Pip
Download <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py">get-pip.py</a> to a folder on your computer. Open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder containing get-pip.py. Then run python get-pip.py. This will install pip

Create virtual environment
pip install virtualenv

activate environment
for windows
myenv\Scripts\activate

for Mac
source myenv/bin/activate

Install all requirements of this project
pip install requirement.txt

then run the apis using
python manage.py runserver localhost:8000

Apis can be accessed with url
http://localhost:8000/leads/
